I made this app to be able to have the songset displayed on a tablet when playing live with my band. 
This PWA is installed on the tablet of the singer that uses it to reorder his songs and read the lyrics.

The app makes the most of all the spaces available in the viewport by displaying the text in columns.
It is also possible to increase and decrease the size of the lyrics to have them fitting the screen.
